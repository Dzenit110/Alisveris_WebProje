## About E-Commerce Project

The project titled "E-Commerce Project" was developed using modern tools. The project is based on an online shopping system (similar to platforms like Trendyol or Hepsiburada), where, besides the regular user, there is also a seller and an admin panel. The backend can be regulated via this admin panel, allowing for image updates, approval of new user registrations, monitoring of new products (adding, deleting, modifying), and tracking the shipment of the product from order confirmation to delivery. Additionally, for pricing, payment can be made in cash, online, or by credit card (Stripe API, VISA, MasterCard, etc.). The user has the option to enter a coupon, which the admin has previously created and approved for use on the admin panel.
<br><br>

On the admin panel, all essential settings are available, such as when a user visited the site, which items were returned and not purchased, how many items were sold, and the current stock levels in the warehouse, etc. Besides the admin, there is a customer panel, where a regular user can register themselves or their company as a seller of certain items. After admin approval, the customer can add or remove products, etc. It's important to note that the customer cannot order one or more products without registration or logging in. The customer, or user, can add desired products to the wishlist or comparison list, where they can see important information about the product and decide which product to purchase.
<br><br>

For purchased products, the customer can cancel the order before the product is shipped, while the item is still on the way. Additionally, the customer can leave a comment and rating for the purchased product and can also read and view comments from other users. The user can also see how many items are available for purchase and which manufacturer placed them for sale. Finally, there is a seller panel where the seller can track orders and get basic information about their products during the online sales process.<br><br>


This project is based on a realistic online shopping and selling system. Everything has been done in detail, as described above. You can see the screenshots, and at the end, the tools and technologies used for the realization of this project are listed.
